# <b>Claims</b>

The Kusari network is SwapDex's experimental, community-focused research & development network. If you held the SDX ERC-20 token or SDX coins at the time of the genesis block of Kusari, you are entitled to claim an equivalent amount of TSDX on the Kusari network.

You can claim TSDX by signing a message with the Ethereum account that holds your SDX tokens or coins.

!!! hint
    **The deadline for claiming TSDX is October, 24th 2021**
