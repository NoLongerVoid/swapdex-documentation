## **Setting up a local Kusari node for WASM/EVM development**

This guide walks you through how to quickly fire up a personal Kusari blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

!!! note
    **Note** This is a fast-track way to run a node. You can always compile from source as well. We recommend using your own compiled binaries for production mainnet.

!!! note
    **Note** Note If you don't have Docker installed, you can quickly [install it from here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

You can clone our repo with docker-compose to get started right away:

```
git clone https://github.com/edgeware-network/edgeware-node
cd edgeware-node
docker run --rm -it decentration/edgeware:v3.3.3
cd docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

!!! note
    **Note** If you want to reset or purge the local chain, delete the docker container by running `docker-compose rm`

Now you should see a series of status updates in your terminal.

Afterwards you can head to [Substrate Explorer App](https://substrate-explorer-testnet.swapdex.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fswapdex.starkleytech.com%2Fws#/treasury) and connect to `127.0.0.1:9944`, and you should see blocks being produced.

Now you can continue to connect Metamask, Remix, and Web3.js to have great experience.
